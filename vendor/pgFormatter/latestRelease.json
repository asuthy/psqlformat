  "body": "August 31 2020 - v4.4\r\n\r\nThis is a maintenance release to fix issues reported by users since\r\nthe last six months. As usual there is also some improvements and\r\nnew features.\r\n\r\nNew options and features:\r\n```\r\n  * Add command line option --extra-function to apply formatting to\r\n    a user defined list of function like with PG internal functions.\r\n  * Add --no-rcfile / -X option to avoid loading user configuration\r\n    file. Thanks to Norbert Buchmueller for the patch.\r\n  * Add -i | --inplace command line option to override an input file\r\n    with the resulting formatted content.\r\n  * Add new command line option -L, --no-extra-line. By default an\r\n    empty line is added after the end of a statement when it is\r\n    terminated by a semi-colon except in a plpgsql code block.\r\n    If the extra empty line at end of the output is useless, you can\r\n    remove it by adding this option to the command line.\r\n  * Add option -C, --wrap-comment to enable comment wrapping. Used\r\n    to wrap comments at the length defined by -w or --wrap-limit\r\n    whatever is the part of the comment. Indent is not included in\r\n    the character count.\r\n  * Add Dockerfile that builds image with pgformatter.\r\n```\r\nHere is the complete list of changes and acknowledgments:\r\n```\r\n  - Fix unwanted extra new line after comment.\r\n  - Add Dockerfile that builds image with pgformatter. The tool can\r\n    then be run as\r\n        cat file.sql | docker run --rm -a stdin -a stdout -i darold.net/pgformatter -\r\n    where darold.net/pgformatter is name of the image build using\r\n        docker build -t darold.net/pgformatter .\r\n    Thanks to Manish Tomar for the patch.\r\n  - Add new option --extra-function and associated configuration\r\n    directive extra-function.  pgFormatter applies some formatting to\r\n    the PostgreSQL internal functions call but it can not detect user\r\n    defined function. It is possible to defined a list of functions\r\n    into a file (one name per line) and give it to pgFormatter through\r\n    the --extra-function option that will be formatter as PostgreSQL\r\n    internal functions. Thanks to Sven Klemm for the feature request.\r\n  - Fix unwanted space inserting inside triple single quotes. Thanks\r\n    to Caleb Cushing for the report.\r\n  - Add -i | --inplace command line option to override an input file\r\n    with the resulting formatted content. Thanks to Francilio Araujo\r\n    for the feature request.\r\n  - Fix an other uncaught exception and formatting issue to insert\r\n    statement. Thanks to allprecisely for the report.\r\n  - Add new command line option -L, --no-extra-line. By default an\r\n    empty line is always added after the end of a statement when it\r\n    is terminated by a ; except in a plpgsql code block. If the extra\r\n    empty line at end of the output is useless, you can remove it by\r\n    using this option. Thanks to Wael Nasreddine for the feature\r\n    request and David Johnston for the patch review.\r\n  - Fix new uncaught exception with non semi-colon terminated query.\r\n    Thanks to allprecisely for the report.\r\n  - Order options list in alphabetic order for usage output.\r\n  - Use env PG_FORMAT to check that pg_format compiles ok and improve\r\n    regression test. Thank to Norbert Buchmueller for the patches.\r\n  - Do not read configuration file if the filename is empty. Thank to\r\n    Norbert Buchmueller for the patch.\r\n  - Add support of pg_trgm operators. Thanks to Carlo Hyvonen for the\r\n    report.\r\n  - Fix some regexp with or condition.\r\n  - Add word boundaries when AS statements require a newline. Thanks\r\n    to Vikrum Nijjar for the patch.\r\n  - Add possible use of configuration file. Thanks to Duncan Holm for\r\n    the feature request.\r\n  - Fix case of time zone data type.\r\n  - Add new regression test about data type and function case.\r\n  - Fix upper case of column name with the same name as a data type.\r\n    Thanks to Jacques Dafflon for the report.\r\n  - Fix upper case of double precision data type.\r\n  - Fix upper case when object name is also a built-in function.\r\n    Thanks to Jacques Dafflon for the report.\r\n  - Fix special handling of MySQL code delimiter // or $$. Thanks to\r\n    Clement Aubert for the test cases.\r\n  - Fix integrity of comments broken with last commits. Thanks to mjfs\r\n    for the report and tests cases.\r\n  - Fix special case of DELIMITER followed by a ;. Thanks to Clement\r\n    Aubert for the report.\r\n  - Fix newline after a comment inside a function parameters. Thanks\r\n    to mfs for the report.\r\n  - Complete previous patch when --comma-start is used.\r\n  - Change position of a comma when it appears after a comment if\r\n    option -b | --comma-start is not use.\r\n  - Fix error related to modification of non-creatable array value.\r\n    Thanks to John Walsh and Mark Fletcher for the report.\r\n  - Add hints on using stdin as input to pg_format. Thanks to Vignesh\r\n    Raja for the suggestion.\r\n  - Fix several incorrect case conversion for data types. Thanks to\r\n    Jacques Dafflon for the report.\r\n  - Fix wrong case of function detection in a CREATE TABLE statement\r\n    when the name of the table is also the name of a function. Thanks\r\n    to Jacques Dafflon for the report.\r\n  - Fix uncaught exception. Thanks to George MacKerron for the report.\r\n  - Fix connection limit formatting in CREATE ROLE. Thanks to Nathan\r\n    Cahill for the report.\r\n  - Fix unwanted code formatting in format() function. Thanks to Ervin\r\n    Weber for the report.\r\n  - Fix indentation in identity column GENENERATED BY clause. Thanks\r\n    to Peter Boromissza for the report.\r\n```"
